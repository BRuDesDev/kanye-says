# Kanye Says... A Kanye REST App
A funny GUI desktop app that displays a new quote from Kanye West' Twitter everytime you push the button with his face in it. 
I am using the 'Kanye Rest' API to scrape tweets

## NEW VERSION
I have remade this app with some new stuff I have learned since initially creating it. 
Main changes I have made:
  * Using ttkbootstrap library for some nicer styling 
  * Added flip (mirror horizontally) animation of Kanye's head each time he is clicked. 
  * Added a History feature, where the user can toggle a window that shows all quotes
  * Created an up-vote and down-vote button that allows the user to give a quote thumbs up or down
  * The user's like or dislike is shown in the history window with the quote
